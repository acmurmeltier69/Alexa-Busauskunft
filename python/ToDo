ToDo Items for Alexa-Busauskunft skill
======================================
  
  - command-line support for ASEAG API
    - aseag_api.py [-org DEP_STOP_ID] [-dest DESTINATION_STOP_ID] [-line LINENUMBER] [-dir IN_OUT] [-t TRANSPORT] [-raw]
	   - if no origin is given, system uses default-stop 
	   - if no destination is given, system shows departures from origin
	   output: if '-raw' is given, present raw output from ASEAG API, else give simplified output   
    
 - fix "stadteinwärts" / "stadtauswärts" for all stations
 
 - treat {Transport} slot as filter to searches

 - treat {Next} slot to define which results are read back to user

 - remove debug output for published version

 - allow "city" as destination --> choose default stop for bus/train
